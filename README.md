# SATM
Our Java implementation of Self-Aggregation-Based Topic Model (SATM)

The hyper-parameters are included in src/main.java, the way of loading dataset is included in suc/Document.java, it's better for you to read and change some codes (if necessaray) before you apply them.

Wish our code can help your research =-=
